// XOR Linked List â€“ A Memory Efficient Doubly Linked List 

/*
1) A function to insert a new node at the beginning.
2) A function to traverse the list in forward direction.

INSERTION
We store XOR of next and previous nodes with every node, which is the only address member we have with every node.
When we insert a new node at the beginning, npx of new node will always be XOR of NULL and current head. 
And npx of current head must be changed to XOR of new node and node next to current head.

PRINT
Traverses the list in forward direction.
To traverse the list, we need to get pointer to the next node at every point. 
We can get the address of next node by keeping track of current node and previous node. 
If we do XOR of curr->npx and prev, we get the address of next node.
